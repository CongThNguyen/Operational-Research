    "As the audience may observe, operational research (OR) is a very useful tools. Even though the solution above may not be ideal (due to it being decimal values), it still provides us powerful insights and help us make better decision. The next question to ask is whether we should be rounding up or rounding down the number of chairs and tables the carpenter can make. For the problem above, we could have formulated it as a (strict) integer linear programming (ILP) problem and the optimal solution of that problem will tell us exactly how many chairs and tables (in integer values) the carpenter should make. However that is a topic for another day. \n",
