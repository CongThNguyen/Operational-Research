# Operational-Research

When talking to people, many often ask me what is operational research ? Abstractly, operational research is a branch of Mathematics (Optimization Mathematics) and it provides optimal outcomes given any problems. Most of the time, I find myself giving people different kinds of answer because this topic is fairly tricky to explain without an example at hand so here I give you an example (coming from this [this page](http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/or/morelp.html)):

> A carpenter makes tables and chairs. Each table can be sold for a profit of £30 and each chair for a profit of £10.
> 1. The carpenter can afford to spend up to 40 hours per week working and takes six hours to make a table and three hours to make a chair.
> 2. Customer demand requires that they make at least three times as many chairs as tables.
> 3. Tables take up four times as much storage space as chairs and there is room for at most four tables each week.
