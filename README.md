# Operational-Research

When talking to people, many often ask me what is operational research (OR) ? Abstractly, operational research (OR) is a branch of Mathematics (Optimization Mathematics) and it helps decision makers reach an optimal outcomes given any problems. Whenver this question arise in the social context, I often find myself providing different kinds of answer because this topic is fairly tricky to explain without an example at hand so here, I give you an example (coming from this [this page](http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/or/morelp.html)):

> A carpenter makes tables and chairs. Each table can be sold for a profit of £30 and each chair for a profit of £10.
> 1. The carpenter can afford to spend up to 40 hours per week working and takes six hours to make a table and three hours to make a chair.
> 2. Customer demand requires that they make at least three times as many chairs as tables.
> 3. Tables take up four times as much storage space as chairs and there is room for at most four tables each week.

This problem a linear programming problem and to solve it we need to formulate it as mathematical equations. Similar to any mathematical problems, we first need to identify the objective of the problem, then we formulate the constraint and finally solve it.
